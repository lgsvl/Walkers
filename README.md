## Walkers

This repo contains Walker style pedestrian NPCs for SVL Simulator.
To include these Pedestrians in your simulator, build asset bundles for them following below steps:

Place Walkers in Assets/External/Pedestrians/ in separate named folders to have all Pedestrians show up in the build menu.

To build an external Pedestrian:

1. Open Simulator -> Build... menu item
2. Select Pedestrians in the build window
3. Click Build

The bundle will be built and placed in the AssetBundles folder in source code. Now build the simulator.
